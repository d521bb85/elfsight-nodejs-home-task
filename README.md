# Elfsight Node.js Home Task

Hi,

We're happy to welcome you to the next stage of our hiring process â€” the home task.

## The task
Implement the service which meets the requirements enlisted below.

### Functional
- A user can add a valid link to any web page.
- Links added by a user are being automatically classified/categorized by it's content.
- A user can retrieve added links, optionally filtered by a category.

### Non-functional

- A user can access a service via HTTP API.
- Its implemented with `TypeScript` and `Node.js`.
- It uses either MySQL/MariaDB or PostgreSQL.
- The choice of a web framework is not limited, however we prefer `NestJS` or pure `Express`.
- Its free of bugs and works smoothly.
- _(recommended)_ It is covered with tests.

## Hints
- We're not asking you to implement the classification by yourself, instead, we recommend you to use a free content classification API or an open source library you may find suitable. For example, [Klazify](https://www.klazify.com/) could be a good choice.
- In the home task, we're not concerned about identity and access management. So, you can come up with a very basic implementation of authentication or skip it at all.

Please, don't hesitate to reach out to us if you have any questions or in case you face an issue.

We wish you the best. Happy codding!

Elfsight Engineering Team.
